### Section 1 Introduction
- Introduction to the Course

Spring reduces the complexity of enterprise java applications. Incredibly modular architecture of spring helps in picking and choosing the right spring modules to use to suit our needs. Spring reduces the cost of programming to interfaces to almost zero.

### Section 2  Why is Spring Popular?

We love looking at the big picture. Before we start with getting into technical details and getting our hands dirty, lets look at few of the things Spring helps with. 

Spring is one of the first layer independent frameworks.

The things discussed here are dependent on one another. Unit Testing builds up Loose Coupling. Architecture Flexibility is a result of Spring Modules.

- Dependency Injection
- Loose Coupling
- Spring Modules
- Architectural Flexibility - Great integration with other frameworks and helps us pick and choose the right ones.
- Unit Testing
